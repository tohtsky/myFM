myFM - Bayesian Factorization Machines in Python/C++
====================================================

**myFM** is an unofficial implementation of Bayesian Factorization Machines. Its goals are to

* implement a `libFM <http://libfm.org/>`_ - like functionality that is easy to use from Python
* provide a simpler and faster implementation with `Pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_ and `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`_

If you have a standard Python environment on MacOS/Linux, you can install the library from PyPI: ::

   pip install myfm

It has an interface similar to sklearn, and you can use them for wide variety of prediction tasks.
For example,

.. testcode::

   from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn import metrics

   from myfm import MyFMClassifier

   dataset = load_breast_cancer()
   X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(dataset['data'])
   y = dataset['target']

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
      X, y, random_state=42
   )
   fm = MyFMClassifier(rank=2).fit(X_train, y_train)

   print(metrics.roc_auc_score(y_test, fm.predict_proba(X_test)))
   # 0.9954

.. testoutput::
   :hide:
   :options: +ELLIPSIS

   0.99...


Try out the following :ref:`examples <MovielensIndex>` to see how Bayesian approaches to explicit collaborative filtering
are still very competitive (almost unbeaten)!

One of the distinctive features of myFM is the support for ordinal regression with probit link function.
See :ref:`the tutorial <OrdinalRegression>` for its usage.

In version 0.3, we have also implemented Variational Inference, which converges faster and requires lower memory (as we don't have to keep numerous samples).
